        Usage
        -----
        
        Usage is really simple and has been thought so that it resembles how most dumper programs work.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            # dump to stdout
            etcdumper dump https://etcd.example.com:4001
        
            # dump to file
            etcdumper --file dump.json dump https://etcd.example.com:4001
        
            # restore from file
            etcdumper --file dump.json restore http://localhost:4001
        
            # try to maintain the same indexes as in the original cluster
            etcdumper --file dump.json --preserve-indexes restore https://etcd.example.com:4001
        
            #dump & restore in one command using pipes
            etcdumper dump https://etcd.example.com:4001 | etcdumper restore http://localhost:4001
